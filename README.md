# BurgasPlacesApp

**<h1>Idea:</h1>**
* Basically, the app provides sort of a catalogue for the most renowned places to eat, drink and have fun in my hometown.
 There are 5 categories of places - cafes, restaurants, fastfood places, nightclubs and places that work 24/7. Name, address, working hours, a photo of the place and a little bit of why you should visit each one, are all included as pieces of info. Functionalities currently availabe are: adding to favourites and calling the place directly from your phone.
